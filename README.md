Currency-note-Authentication
This project authenticates currency notes using image processing and feature matching with ORB in OpenCV.

Purpose and Application:
To verify the authenticity of currency notes using image processing and feature matching techniques. This can be used in banks, shops, and ATMs to detect counterfeit currency.

Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
Google Colab (for prototyping)
How It Works
Upload an authentic note and a test note.
Extract key features using ORB.
Match features with BFMatcher.
Authenticate based on the number of matching features.
Usage
Clone the repository.
Install the required packages.
Run main.py and upload the note images.
##Conclusion A lightweight and effective way to detect fake currency using computer vision.
